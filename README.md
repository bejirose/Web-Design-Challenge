# Weather Data nalysis using Web-Design (HTML, CSS)

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

- Created the following visualizations and their corresponding explanations.

1)  A landing page containing:
  - An explanation of the project.
  - Links to each visualizations page.
2)  Four visualization pages, each with:
  - A descriptive title and heading tag.
  - The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  - A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
3)  A "Comparisons" page that:
  - Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  - Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations: Createdd two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
4)  A "Data" page that:
  - Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  - Creatd a bootstrap table component.
5) Creatd The a navigation menu on each page that:
  - Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
  - Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
  - Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
  - Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change).
